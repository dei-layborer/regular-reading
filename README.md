# Regular Reading

A web-based tool for formatting text to improve legibility for some who may struggle with reading large blocks of text.

This program is inspired by, but in no way affiliated with, Bionic Reading.

Simply put, I hope to make reading easier for some people who may have difficulties otherwise.  The inspiration from Bionic Reading is obvious, but I'm doing this project entirely on my own.  They've chosen to monetize their version, and while I don't necessarily blame them (I certainly don't know what their costs have been and continue to be), I don't want anyone to be excluded from possible benefits due to the cost.

I fortunately do not myself  have the difficulties with large blocks of text that this tool seeks to address.  But I do have people close to me that do, and they've been helpful in testing.  Individual experience may vary, and of course whether this tool is helpful shouldn't be taken to mean you do or don't have a particular condition.  Feedback is of course welcome: if something doesn't work properly or if you have a suggestion for how this tool could be better or help more people, by all means open an issue here on GitHub.

A live, (hopefully) up-to-date version is hosted [on my neocities site](https://deilayborer.neocities.org/regular-reading/).
